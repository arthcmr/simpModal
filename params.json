{"name":"Simpmodal","tagline":"Simple jQuery Modal plugin","body":"#simpModal\r\nsimpModal is a simple modal jquery plugin based on leanModal by FinelySliced ([Visit their page](http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/)). I built simpModal because I wanted flexibility. Many of the modal plugins I've seen out there rely on lots of HTML markup, which makes them too complex for simple things. Plus, I wanted to be able to code my CSS separately from the plugin, which certainly makes it a lot more designer-friendly. Finally, I wanted the plugin to add/destroy any necessary HTML tags it uses, so that I wouldn't have unnecessary tags flying around my code when a modal isn't visible.\r\n\r\nUsing simpModal is quite simple and you can start with something as simple as this:\r\n```\r\n$.simpModal({ content: \"Simple Message\" });\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Simple\r\n* Flexible width and height\r\n* Independent CSS\r\n* Ajax Support\r\n* Image Free\r\n* Very light (less than 4Kb)\r\n* Multiple instances on the same page\r\n* Many options\r\n* Very easy to use\r\n\r\n### Options\r\nThere are many options, but not enough to make it confusing. It's actually quite simple to use them. Take a look at the default options:\r\n```\r\n$.simpModal({\r\n\ttop: 100,\r\n\toverlay: 0.4,\r\n\textraClass: null,\r\n\telement: null,\r\n\tlink: null,\r\n\tfile: null,\r\n\tparams: null,\r\n\tmethod: 'post',\r\n\tcontent: null,\r\n\twidth: null,\r\n\tcloseButton: false,\r\n\tloadingMessage: \"Loading...\",\r\n\tspeed: 200,\r\n\ttransition: 'fade',\r\n\tclickEnter: true,\r\n\tcloseEsc: true,\r\n\tclose: false\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Show Close Button\r\nYou may want to display a nice looking button:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.simpModal({\r\n        content: \"Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse molestie consequat, vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis.\",\r\n        closeButton: true\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Extra Class\r\nYou may apply any class to your modal so that you can have multiple modal styles\r\n```\r\n$.simpModal({\r\n        ...\r\n        extraClass: 'narrow'\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Support/Contact\r\nThat's basically it!
