simpModal
=========

**simpModal** is a simple modal jquery plugin based on leanModal by FinelySliced ([See their website](http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/)).

I built **simpModal** because I wanted flexibility. Many of the modal plugins I've seen out there rely on lots of HTML markup, which makes them too complex for simple things. Plus, I wanted to be able to code my CSS separately from the plugin, which certainly makes it a lot more designer-friendly. Finally, I wanted the plugin to add/destroy any necessary HTML tags it may need automatically, so that I wouldn't have unnecessary tags when a modal isn't visible.
